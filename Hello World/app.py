'''First line of code
Starting with print fuction
'''

# we use print function to print message or something on the screen
print("Hello World ")
# when working with text you put it in between qoutes single or double qoutation

'''Now lets say we want to print * 10 times'''

print("*" * 10)  # instead of writing print 10 times,we times it by 10

# and also notice that each line has been executed line-by-line from top to bottom
